    advice: 'A good password is easy to remember but hard for a stranger to guess. Uncommon words work well, but only if you use several. Also helpful: non-standard uPPercasing, creative spelllling, personal neologisms, and non-obvious numbers and symbols (using $ for s or 0 for o is too obvious!)'
